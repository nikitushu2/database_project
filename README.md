This project is a RESTful API for a blog application built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL. It provides comprehensive functionality for managing blogs, users, and reading lists. Users can create accounts, authenticate with JWT tokens (with server-side session tracking), create and manage blog posts, search blogs by title or author, and organize content in reading lists. The application includes features like admin privileges, user account management (including disabling accounts), author statistics tracking, and a reading status system that allows users to mark blog posts as read or unread.
